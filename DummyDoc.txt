Jacob Deffendall:
	This summer, I did a lot of wood work. My parents wanted a lot of furniture made, so I ended up
doing that for most of my summer. First, I made two outdoor chairs for our back porch. Next I made a little
table to put between the chairs. Next, I made three wooden end tables. I ended up selling two of them, and
the third I gave to my parents. Next, I made a bunk bed for my younger siblings, which ended up being very
difficult. Finally, I made a bench that my parents wanted to go on our front porch. So while I couldn't get
a job, I was able to make some money and spend my time doing some useful things.

Evan Knapke:
	This summer, I worked at a landscaping job every day. I worked 6 days every week putting doing various 
landscaping duties. I worked at a clients house that he was building, putting in his plants and stone features. 
Most days I was putting in stone paths or boulders for the client. Some days I would be planting massive trees,
some days I would be planting tiny ground cover. Sadly, I did not have much time to work on my software projects 
this summer and I really slacked on that. But overall, I enjoyed working and had a good summer.

Kade D:
	Over the summer, I worked on a few software development projects. I made a mobile app for ordering from a 
small restaurant and a website to help employees work from home. I also spent a lot of time building custom toy boxes.
I enjoyed buying furniture and decorations for my new apartment which I moved into recently. Any extra time I had left
I spent playing Rocket League and Counter-Strike.

Zach H:
	During the summer, I worked a couple of jobs. I worked part-time at my town's parks department mowing and 
keeping the local parks in shape. My second job was working night shift at Trane in Rushville. There I was mostly in the 
department for making the cylinders for the units we made. The rest of time I spent with my family and my year old niece.
I would work at the parks department in the mornings and then go to Trane in the evenings everyday. I was tired, but I 
enjoy working and making new friends.
